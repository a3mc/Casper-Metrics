### API Overview

*This document will be updated soon with the Milestone 3 of the project.*

You can observe the available endpoints and try them out in a Swagger interface on the [Front Part](https://caspermetrics.io/api).

While it's possible to get a lot of data from the endpoints, the Swagger interface is more to provide examples and the description of each endpoint.
